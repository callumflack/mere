# Mere ecommerce website

## Local dev

Run the Keystone server on port 4000: `PORT=4000 nodemon server.js`

Run the next.js client: `npm run dev`

## To deploy the next client

Simply `now && now alias` as per `now.json`.

## To deploy the keystone server

1. Create a `now` deployment.
2. `now alias` the deployment to admin.vjraystrata.com.au
3. The client's footer login link is `admin.vjraystrata.com.au/keystone`, no further fixes required.
4. You don't need to do anything to the client, because it's `@vjr_server_uri` `now secret` is always set to the aliased server URI.

## Learnings

If you ever move to a new mongodb instance, remember to:

* update both `server.env` & `client.env`
* run new client & server deployments and alias them to the production website's URLs
* you won't need to update the `@vjr_server_uri` `now secret` as it is always set to the aliased server URI.
