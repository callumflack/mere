                  p MERE embodies a profound sense of connection and responsibility for the natural world. True to our Australian roots we sit on the forefront of ecological awareness with a focus on sustainable and ethical practices embedded within our brand DNA.
                  p It is with this respect that we consciously consider the MERE footprint we leave on the environment and our responsibility to preserve and protect these vital natural resources.
                  p.AccentParagraph MERE is packaged in 100% recyclable Miron Glass vessels carefully selected to preserve and protect the vital life force of the nature that we extract. The Biophotonic science of this unique glass serves to filter the light frequencies responsible for decomposition whilst allowing the infiltration of violet light frequencies that have been proven to activate the molecular structure of the formula held within.
                  p.m-l5 All other packaging is assembled from resources that are amongst the worlds most recycled materials. We believe we should be as active for the environment as we are for the skin.
